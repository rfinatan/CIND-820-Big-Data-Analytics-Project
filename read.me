# An Analysis of Canadian Marine Accident Fatality Factors

The main topic of research in this study is the analysis of marine accidents occurring in
Canadian waters for the years 1995 to 2022. More specifically, the research question is aimed
at identifying the key factors involved in Canadian marine accident fatalities and quantifying the
respective factorsâ€™ contributions to serious marine incidents.
A formalized version of the research question reads as follows:
For the years 1995 to 2022, what key factors involved in Canadian marine accidents have
quantifiably shown a statistically significant contribution to marine accident fatalities?
